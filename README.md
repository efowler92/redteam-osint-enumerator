üîé Red Team OSINT Enumerator (Educational Simulation)
This is a mock OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) username enumeration tool built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

It simulates what an OSINT recon tool might reveal about a username across public platforms.
This app is 100% educational and does not perform real data lookups or API calls.

‚úÖ Live Demo:
https://redteam-osint-enumerator.replit.app/

(Hosted on Replit for demo purposes)

‚úÖ Features:
‚úÖ Simple web interface for entering a username

‚úÖ Simulated "OSINT results" pulled from a fake data set

‚úÖ No real network requests, scraping, or external API calls

‚úÖ Designed for training, cybersecurity education, and portfolio demonstration

‚úÖ Deployable and safe for use in school projects or awareness sessions

‚úÖ Technologies Used:
HTML5

CSS3

Vanilla JavaScript

Replit deployment environment

‚úÖ Educational Purpose:
This tool is part of my Cybersecurity & IT learning portfolio while pursuing my Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Cybersecurity at WGU.

It demonstrates:

Awareness of OSINT techniques

Understanding of Red Team reconnaissance phases

Front-end web development skills

Ethical tool-building for educational use

‚úÖ Example User Flow:
Enter a username like coolhacker123

Click "Run OSINT Simulation"

The app displays fake public "results" such as:


‚úÖ Found on Twitter
‚úÖ Found on Reddit
‚úÖ Involved in 3 known data breaches
If a username isn‚Äôt in the mock database, it returns:

\
No public OSINT data found for this username (simulated)
‚úÖ Planned Future Enhancements:
Add an option to pull real OSINT data using safe public APIs (with user consent and ethical restrictions)

Expand the fake data set for more username testing

Add export-to-CSV functionality for demo reports

Improve UI/UX design for better realism

‚úÖ Disclaimer:
‚ö†Ô∏è This tool is for educational and demonstration purposes only.

It does not perform real OSINT queries.

No external network calls or data scraping occur.

It exists only to showcase safe, ethical OSINT concepts in cybersecurity education.
